## Modern Stock Trading Platform

The Robinhood Clone is a comprehensive full-stack application that replicates the core functionality of the popular stock trading platform. Built with a React frontend and Python backend, it provides users with a seamless trading experience, real-time market data, and portfolio management tools.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Market Data**: Integration with Yahoo Finance API to provide up-to-date stock prices, charts, and market information for over 10,000 global stocks
  
- **Interactive Portfolio**: Visualize your investments with responsive charts displaying performance over time, sector allocation, and profit/loss tracking
  
- **Secure Trading**: Implement robust account management and transaction processing with comprehensive error handling and security measures
  
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive user interface that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Technical Implementation

The project is structured as a modern web application with a clean separation of concerns:

#### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI with hooks for state management
- **Chart.js**: Interactive data visualization for stock prices and portfolio performance
- **CSS Modules**: Styled with modular CSS for maintainable styling
- **Jest/React Testing Library**: 98% test coverage ensuring reliable functionality

#### Backend
- **Python**: Core application logic and API handling
- **Flask API**: RESTful API endpoints for data exchange
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure user authentication
- **Data Processing**: Financial data transformation and analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to build complex, interactive financial applications that combine modern frontend techniques with robust backend services. It showcases skills in both technical implementation and financial domain knowledge, particularly in stock market operations and portfolio management.
